Bubble-Bash is a 2D board game in which player 
has to match 3 or more bubbles to score within 
a limited period of time.

This project is coded in c++ using [SFML Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/).

Our project was completed under the guidance 
of [Prof. Saurabh Joshi Sir](https://github.com/sbjoshi)
for Final Evaluation of *CS1023:Software 
Development Fundamentals* course at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) 
for academic year 2020-2021. 

For our project we developed our own Game Engine. 
This Game Engine can be used again and again for 
developing different kinds of games.
