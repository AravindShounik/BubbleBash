Bubble-Bash is a 2D board game in which player 
has to match 3 or more bubbles to score within 
a limited period of time.

This project is coded in c++ using [SFML Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/).

Our project was completed under the guidance 
of [Prof. Saurabh Joshi Sir](https://github.com/sbjoshi)
for Final Evaluation of *CS1023:Software 
Development Fundamentals* course at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) 
for academic year 2020-2021. 

For our project we developed our own Game Engine. 
This Game Engine can used again and again for 
developing different kinds of games.


## Features

- Reusable Game Engine
- Time Limit Challange
- Easy Interface
- Soothing Background Music

  
## Installation Required 

To run our project, We need to install the
following Items:

 **1.   C++ Compiler (GNU G++)** 
 
 To Install, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
  sudo apt install g++
```

**2. Build System (Make)**

To install, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
sudo apt install make
```
**3. SFML- Simple and Fast Multimedia Library**

To install, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

## Deployment

To compile the project we used *Make(Build system)* .

So to compile, run the following one-worded code 
after changing your working directory to the
project folder :

```bash
  make
```
Now, you can simply run the *executable* 
from *bin* or we can use the following code 

```bash
bin/main
```
